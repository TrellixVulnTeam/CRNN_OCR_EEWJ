## CRNN for recognizing handwritten text in Vietnamese

![CRNN's structure](images/art.png)

This is the implementation for the paper [An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Image-based Sequence
Recognition and Its Application to Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf). We used this method to evaluate our handwriting image dataset.
